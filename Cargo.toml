[dependencies]
bootloader = "0.9.23" # This crate implements a basic BIOS bootloader without any C dependencies, just Rust and inline assembly.
volatile = "0.2.6" # This crate provides a Volatile wrapper type with read and write methods. These methods internally use the read_volatile and write_volatile functions of the core library and thus guarantee that the reads/writes are not optimized away.
spin = "0.5.2" # To use a spinning mutex

[dependencies.lazy_static] # This crate provides a lazy_static! macro that defines a lazily initialized static.
version = "1.0"
features = ["spin_no_std"] # We need the spin_no_std feature, since we donâ€™t link the standard library.
